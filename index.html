Let's hack /j.
Use all your JS skills, and make this site into something special.
Cool stuff you should know:
- If you delete the textarea, just use the console.
- Don't reload the page -- if you want to save your project <del>get a life</del> google how to turn off auto reload in your browser of choice.
- Use Firefox, it's better /hj
- You can change the style with js, but the names are a bit different... google.
- Just google, ok?
